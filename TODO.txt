Logic to implement

    2.  If current user is pub and socket is connected, user cannot create another party unless they are sub.

Server

    1.  Write function to emit user data for all users in a room. Used to display room members on client side.


Client

    1.  Fix the FaBars padding on collapsed sidebar.
    2.  Sidebar should disappear after few seconds when collapsed.
    3.  Link the icons from the sidebar to functions in the components.
    4.  Add CSS transition for the sidebar content. Icons, buttons, etc.
    5.  Write function to display user data when user icon clicked.
    6.  Write function to query display room members when members icon clicked.
    7.  Listen to server on whether or not pub disconnected and you are new pub.



Done :
    4.  Subscriber should Pause vid when Publisher pauses vid. This change could be on client or server side.
    1.  If room pub leaves, then randomly choose new pub. Update the client accordingly.
    3.  When client closes tab that socket should disconnect.
    4.  Restrict number of allowed users in a room.
